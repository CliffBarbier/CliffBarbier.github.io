<p>I am a road warrior.</p>

<p>There are many out there like me.</p>

<p>I sleep in a hotel for much of the year. A different hotel every month; every week; every night.</p>

<p>I eat in delicious restaurants that the TV shows will never find. I eat rubbery hotel eggs floating in water.</p>

<p>I travel for miles, navigating the roads, the trains, and the airports to reach my destination on time and safely.</p>

<p>I live out of my car; truck; carry-on. My daily life must fit inside 22 inches.</p>

<p>Half my meals are eaten standing up&mdash;half of those while rushing to get somewhere important to me, my boss, or my client.</p>

<p>I have watched my children grow up via webcam.</p>

<p>It is my job to meet for the first time and impress a person; a handful; a dozen; hundreds at a time.  This is difficult on 3 hours sleep.  I subsist on energy drinks, energy shots, or coffee.</p>

<p>I know more about the TSA&rsquo;s screening procedures than half of the TSA officers I come into contact with.  I want to shout, “you’re doing it wrong!”<br/>
But this is the last leg on my trip back home&hellip;</p>

<p>I am a road warrior.</p>

<p>There are many like me.</p>
