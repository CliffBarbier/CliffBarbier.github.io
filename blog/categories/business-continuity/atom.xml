<h2>What Is Emergency Preparedness?</h2>

<p><strong>Business continuity</strong> is an umbrella term for ensuring that an organization&rsquo;s critical business functions will continue to operate or recover to an operational state within a short time.  Not all business continuity problems start out as disasters.  Twitter&rsquo;s once-frequent Fail Whale indicated the runaway success of the service.  <a href="http://whatisfailwhale.info"><img class="left" src="/images/Failwhale.png" width="300" title="&ldquo;Lifting a Dreamer by Yiying Lu&rdquo; &ldquo;A low-resolution screenshot of the Fail Whale on Twitter&rsquo;s website&rdquo;" ></a>  But this success obviously caused problems for their critical business function, receiving and distributing 140-character messages.</p>

<p><strong>Disaster recovery</strong> is a subset of business continuity, which outlines how you recover from an incident.</p>

<p><strong>Emergency preparedness</strong> are the things you do in preparation for an emergency.  Beefing up resiliency, staging materials, and <em>creating a plan</em> are key components of this.</p>

<h2>Questions to ask</h2>

<h4>What are your critical business processes?</h4>

<p>What can you let slide and what has to get done to keep the business going?</p>

<h4>Do you know what you need in the event of an emergency?</h4>

<p>What items, personnel, &amp; skills are necessary for those processes that keep things going?</p>

<h4>Have you set those items aside?</h4>

<p>Recognizing that you&rsquo;ll need form FB-227/R-14 is useless if you don&rsquo;t allocate some to the emergency preparedness bin.  Also, your employee Susie needs to know that you consider her essential.</p>

<h4>Have you tested your plan using <mark>only those items</mark>?</h4>

<h4>Are the items placed where you will need them?</h4>

<p>Designate a continuity site, somewhere that won&rsquo;t be disabled when your main site goes down.  Stash your stuff there and let everyone know that&rsquo;s where to meet after a problem.</p>

<h4>Is all of this checked? On what schedule? By whom?</h4>

<p>The checking process could be a training event in itself&ndash;if it&rsquo;s your turn to check the items this month, you should also go over immediate aftermath responsibilities &amp; be quizzed on them.</p>
