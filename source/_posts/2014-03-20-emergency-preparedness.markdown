My own personal devotion to emergency preparedness cannot be overstated. 

{% pullquote %}
The attention I pay to this critical function borders on one of the true definitions of "<dfn title="Any object or idea eliciting unquestioning reverence, respect, or devotion.">_fetish_</dfn>". Maybe that's because I come from the "[Land of Katrina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina#Louisiana)". Or maybe it's because this subset of the business continuity field is a perfect match for me.  {" It requires adaptation.  It invites constant re-evaluation, constant testing, and a constant push toward greater effectiveness & efficiency. "}

## What Is Emergency Preparedness?
**Business continuity** is an umbrella term for ensuring that an organization's critical business functions will continue to operate or recover to an operational state within a short time.  Not all business continuity problems start out as disasters.  Twitter's once-frequent Fail Whale indicated the runaway success of the service.  [{% img left /images/Failwhale.png 300 "Lifting a Dreamer by Yiying Lu" "A low-resolution screenshot of the Fail Whale on Twitter's website" %}](http://whatisfailwhale.info)  But this success obviously caused problems for their critical business function, receiving and distributing 140-character messages.  

**Disaster recovery** is a subset of business continuity, which outlines how you recover from an incident.  

**Emergency preparedness** are the things you do in preparation for an emergency.  Beefing up resiliency, staging materials, and _creating a plan_ are key components of this.

## Questions to ask
#### What are your critical business processes?
What can you let slide and what has to get done to keep the business going?

#### Do you know what you need in the event of an emergency? 
What items, personnel, & skills are necessary for those processes that keep things going?

#### Have you set those items aside?
Recognizing that you'll need form FB-227/R-14 is useless if you don't allocate some to the emergency preparedness bin.  Also, your employee Susie needs to know that you consider her essential. 

#### Have you tested your plan using <mark>only those items</mark>?
{% pullquote %}
This is a key point...  You'll never be able to fill out FB-227/R-14 without a pencil.  Even more important, once you use up your only copy of FB-227/R-14, are there more?  {" Use only the items in your emergency preparedness bin for the test, then replace what was used. "}
{% endpullquote %}
#### Are the items placed where you will need them?
Designate a continuity site, somewhere that won't be disabled when your main site goes down.  Stash your stuff there and let everyone know that's where to meet after a problem.

#### Is all of this checked? On what schedule? By whom? 
The checking process could be a training event in itself--if it's your turn to check the items this month, you should also go over immediate aftermath responsibilities & be quizzed on them.
